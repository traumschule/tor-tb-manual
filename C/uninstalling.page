<p>
Tor Browser does not affect any of the existing software or settings on
your computer. Uninstalling Tor Browser will not affect your system’s
software or settings.
</p>

<steps>
  <item>
    <p>
    Locate your Tor Browser folder. The default location on Windows is the
    Desktop. On Linux, there is no default location, however the folder will
    be named "tor-browser_en-US" if you installed the English Tor Browser.
    </p>

    Optional: If you registered Tor as an application, now is the time to
    unregister it. It provides a commandline option for that:
    <pre>~/Browser/start-tor-browser --unregister-app</pre>.
    </p>
  </item>

    <p>
    On Windows and Linux, Tor Browser does not install itself in the classic
    sense of applications. You can just delete it.
    </p>
  </item>
  <item>
    <p>
    On macOS, you drag the Tor Browser application icon from the "Applications"
    folder to the trash as you would to uninstall any other application.
    Now delete the directory, which contains the Tor Browser profile.
    If the Tor Browser application is in the Applications folder, the directory
    to remove is <code>~/Library/Application Support/TorBrowser-Data</code>.
    To get to it, press cmd-shift-g while in Finder and copy/paste that
    directory into the box that appears
    (In case you remapped the keyboard shortcuts and no box appears,
    find the folder in your finder and delete it.)
    </p>
  </item>    
  <item>
    <p>Empty your Trash and it is removed from your system.</p>
  </item>
</steps>

<p>
Note that your operating system’s standard “Uninstall” utility is not
used.
